# Lost in the Box

A game made during Global Game Jam 2021. The theme was *Lost and Found.*  

You play in a child's imagination. You've been shrunk down and left alone in your sandbox.  
Before you can find your way out of it, might as well hunt for some treasure. You can use your map to find your way around this gigantic sandbox, or just explore. 
Who knows what's out there?
